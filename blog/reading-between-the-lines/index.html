While these early manifestations of tools unlocked pioneering ideas on the relationship between humans and machines, they were largely conceptual. Engelbart and Kay’s work hinted at a future of creative tools built to enhance the human mind’s creativity and intellect, but the translation of these ideas to tangible artefacts came along much later, in different forms.<br/></mark></p><p id="cff06e42-46a1-4d8e-997c-0f15f695f414" class="">In a 1945 essay titled <a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Bush_1945_-_As_We_May_Think_(Life_Magazine).pdf"><mark class="highlight-default"><em>As we may think</em></mark></a>, Vannevar Bush coined the term &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">memex</a>&quot;.

The memex, in essence, reflects a library of collective knowledge stored in a piece of machinery described in his essay as &quot;a piece of furniture&quot;.<br/>The essay predicted (to some extent) umpteen different kinds of technology invented after its publication, including hypertext, personal computers, the Internet, the World Wide Web, speech recognition, and online encyclopaedias such as Wikipedia ⎯ &quot;Wholly new forms of encyclopaedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.&quot; Bush envisioned the ability to retrieve several articles or pictures on one screen, with the possibility of writing comments that could be stored and recalled together. He believed people would create links between related articles, thus mapping the thought process and path of each user and saving it for others to experience. Wikipedia is one example of how this vision has, in part, been realised, allowing elements of an article to reference other related topics. A user&#x27;s browser history maps the trails of possible paths of interaction, although this is typically available only to the user that created it.<br/></p><p id="4f1ed4d7-56ec-431d-b41b-4f5d21a03551" class="">

The original implementation took shape as a demo that Timothy Kay (founder of ActiveBuddy) programmed in Perl in his Los Altos garage to connect a single buddy ⎯ &quot;ActiveBuddy&quot;, to look up stock symbols, and later allow AOL users to play Colossal Cave Adventure, a famous word-based adventure game, and MIT&#x27;s Boris Katz Start Question Answering System but quickly grew to include a wide range of database applications the company called &#x27;knowledge domains&#x27; including instant access to news, weather, stock information, movie times, yellow pages listings, and detailed sports data, as well as a variety of tools (a personal assistant, calculator, translator, etc.)<br/></p><figure id="379196bf-ce3e-489b-9b67-d8e3527f9200" class="image"><a href="Reading%20between%20the%20lines%2067795472d8354f5b8834c65c0c98c646/Untitled%205.png"><img style="width:2026px" src="Reading%20between%20the%20lines%2067795472d8354f5b8834c65c0c98c646/Untitled%205.png"/></a></figure><p id="f0416495-d8f3-4954-8ec2-241bc32f55a1" class="">Services like SmarterChild and Wolfram Alpha (and it’s elder sibling ⎯ Wolfram Mathematica) were essentially precursors to modern day Siri and Google Assistant.

While the fundamentals remained the same, companies kept building tools to make it easier to extract intents from statements. Early tools like Google’s API.ai (later christened Dialogflow) let users program custom events and actions tied to inputs, but the key issue in machine learning systems remained, having access to enough data to convince the machine that “I want to hear the Eagles” still meant you want to listen to Hotel California and not <a href="https://youtu.be/9RArGl2vkGI?si=kFdYW9dqPat6AqUS">this</a>.</p><p id="fe1ca0d1-6a2a-4071-8df8-490b57e17fda" class="">

As Tony McCaffrey of <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/there-will-always-be-limits-to-how-creative-a-computer-can-be"><em>There Will Always Be Limits to How Creative a Computer Can Be</em></a> states, “The fastest modern supercomputer couldn’t list or explore all the features of an object/thing even if it had started working on the problem way back in the 1950s. When considering the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21650349.2014.893840?journalCode=tdci20">Obscure Features Hypothesis for Innovation</a>, which states that every innovative solution is built upon at least one new or commonly overlooked feature of a problem, you can see how AI may never advance enough to take the jobs of Chief Innovation Officers.” <br/><br/>While there are situations in which computers are able to figure out the steps needed to get from state A to a different state B, it is still within the limitations of human-mandated decomposition. This means that the actions we take with computers are steps that we have already broken down in our head in order to achieve an end result. <br/></p><p id="c039f310-7441-4a79-98b8-1bef9e6e94a5" class="">

First, single-layer representations were learned using word vectors and fed to task-specific architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations and contextual state were used to form stronger representations (though still applied to task-specific architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models have been directly fine-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-specific architectures.</p><p id="6074c05b-9be9-47ed-ad5a-73dd20528ca5" class="">This last paradigm has led to substantial progress on numerous challenging NLP tasks - such as reading comprehension, answering questions, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures and algorithms. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while the architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-specific datasets and task-specific fine-tuning: to achieve strong performance on a desired task typically requires fine-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands of examples specific to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons -<br/><br/></p><ul id="6f071fe0-83e4-402e-b2dd-ac0a9f9f1c40" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">First, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the applicability of language models. There exists an extremely wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing anything from correcting grammar to generating examples of an abstract concept, to critiquing a short story. For many of these tasks, it is difficult to collect a large supervised training dataset, especially when the process must be repeated for every new task.<br/><br/></li></ul><ul id="600d2634-c7b6-41a0-8cbc-10b5f206d487" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Second, the potential to exploit spurious correlations in training data fundamentally grows with the expressiveness of the model and the narrowness of the training distribution.

Each increase has brought improvements in text synthesis and/or downstream NLP tasks, and there is evidence suggesting that log loss, which correlates well with many downstream tasks, follows a smooth trend of improvement with scale [KMH+20].

And even if the format has been repeated in the context prompt, there were a lot of instances of hallucination where the LLM is dreaming up its own schema, and adding key-value pairs that have not been defined. <br/>Even the parameters of the JSON object that were added to the prompt were getting shuffled around or being re-worded. We cannot exactly listen for a field for <br/><code>intent</code> when GPT-3 in its response, transforms it to <code>intention</code>.</p><p id="d993a0dc-b234-4a16-b65c-02ce05d8a229" class="">
</p><p id="1a179e7b-9a48-471c-a8a0-51673aef18e9" class="">One important piece that sets apart this approach from regular classification is that we wanted to also extract arguments from the statement, not just the intent. In a to-do app, you don’t have the affordances to ask the user repeatedly to input arguments, so the entire context needs to be extracted from the get-go. <br/>For eg - Say I want a music player built right inside doneth. I have added a to-do : “Play Indian Ocean on loop at night”. Now from this statement, I want the intent of the user, let’s call it <br/><code>play-music</code> and to the corresponding function that gets called for this intent, say <code>function play_music()</code>, I would also want to pass the band name as a parameter so that I can build a construct where the user clicks on the <code>Play Music</code> button, the program can automatically open Spotify with the artist’s page in front ⎯ ready to play their songs.</p><figure id="a551d18c-0eca-439c-916c-ccf70a233e49" class="image"><a href="Reading%20between%20the%20lines%2067795472d8354f5b8834c65c0c98c646/Untitled%208.png"><img style="width:2878px" src="Reading%20between%20the%20lines%2067795472d8354f5b8834c65c0c98c646/Untitled%208.png"/></a></figure><p id="d9697841-6a1c-4084-901b-5351df8456c6" class="">When you get both the <code>intent</code> and the <code>argument(s)</code>, it affords a far easier picture for you to render dynamic interfaces on top of this ⎯ and this can be extended into far more complex scenarios, converting the LLM into essentially a search engine in latent space.

This leads to a more powerful pattern of rendering full-fledged micro-apps inside the context of a conversation.<br/>Imagine wanting to play sudoku, and a sudoku game is rendered for you on the fly, or a relevant part of your calendar becomes visible when you are trying to resolve a scheduling conflict conversationally.<br/></p><p id="91f6e663-d26a-44e6-8098-c93776f7d2f6" class="">

This facilitates a whole new arena of interfaces that render dynamic bits on the fly as and when the user needs them ⎯ this again caveats to the point of knowing which dynamic bit to render where. <br/>When OpenAI released its code generation model - <br/><code>Codex</code>, it raised expectations of the program knowing which bits of code to render, and in the future, it might lead to computers directly rendering a fresh component instead of just showing the code to render the said component.</p><p id="c3dcc9e9-96a5-4868-bde4-3d504c15d85b" class="">
