At that point, SigNoz had just raised a seed round led by SignalFire, with participation from Uncorrelated Ventures, Alumni Ventures, and angels including Tom Preston Werner (co-founder of GitHub) and Jiten Vaidya (ex-CEO of PlanetScale).</p><p id="1fbd39d6-c19a-8063-96b2-fcbc4d9f948f" class="">SigNoz had just released a managed cloud offering of their open-source observability platform that sought to bring the 3 key signals : <code>Logs</code>, <code>Metrics</code>, and <code>Traces</code> under the same umbrella.</p><p id="1fbd39d6-c19a-800e-9044-f2fc1a71fce5" class="">In the time I have been there, the breadth of my responsibilities has increased to lead multiple product initiatives to revamp the signal explorers and also leading design for newer areas of the product.</p><p id="1fbd39d6-c19a-8044-98cc-ed850175b75f" class="">
